What is your favorite movie?
Moneyball
If you could go anywhere in the world for vacation, where would it be?
I would go to the coast of Italy for not just the views but the food as well.
If you could have any super power, what would it be (and why that power)?
I would want to be able to teleport because it would save so much time and I'd be able to visit so many places I've never been before.
